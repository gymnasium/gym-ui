# Color

A color pallet is defined in `/styles/index.tsx` and can be imported as follows:
`import { typeface } from '../../styles'`

#### Usage examples in CSS-in-JS:

```
background-color: ${color.orange};
background-color: ${color.grey.light};
```

For full list of colors, refer to `src/styles/index.tsx`

# Typeface

Similar to colors, standard typeface fonts are defined in `/styles/index.tsx` and can be imported as follows:
`import { typeface } from '../../styles'`

Currently, there are two typefaces defined:

- `title: 'brandon-grotesque, Josefin Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, sans-serif'`
- `text: 'Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, sans-serif'`

#### Usage examples with CSS-in-JS:

```
font: bold 1.2rem/1.4 ${typeface.title};
```

# Fonts

This library uses a licensed font called `brandon-grotesque`.  
If you don't have this font, the UI components will fall back to use Google font called `Josefin Sans` which is close enough.

To make `Josefin Sans` avaiable, insert the following into the `<head>` of your HTML document:

```
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Josefin+Sans&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Next in line fallback fonts are `Helvetica Neue`, `Helvetica`, and `sans-serif`.
